This dataset is designed to simulate real-world trading scenarios, allowing models to perform agent-based financial trading. The task evaluates the models on multiple financial metrics such as Cumulative Return (CR), Sharpe Ratio (SR), Daily Volatility (DV), Annualized Volatility (AV), and Maximum Drawdown (MD). These metrics provide a comprehensive assessment of the model's profitability, risk management, and decision-making capabilities.



To ensure a fair and unbiased assessment of the models' true capabilities, all evaluations are conducted in zero-shot settings (0-shots). This approach eliminates any potential advantage from task-specific fine-tuning, providing a clear indication of how well the models can generalize to new tasks.

Given the nature of the tasks, which include multiple-choice and yes/no questions, we extract options from the generated text to evaluate performance.

## Some good practices before submitting a model

### 1) Make sure you can load your model and tokenizer using AutoClasses:
```python
from transformers import AutoConfig, AutoModel, AutoTokenizer
config = AutoConfig.from_pretrained("your model name", revision=revision)
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("your model name", revision=revision)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("your model name", revision=revision)
```
If this step fails, follow the error messages to debug your model before submitting it. It's likely your model has been improperly uploaded.

Note: make sure your model is public!
Note: if your model needs `use_remote_code=True`, we do not support this option yet but we are working on adding it, stay posted!

### 2) Convert your model weights to [safetensors](https://huggingface.co/docs/safetensors/index)
It's a new format for storing weights which is safer and faster to load and use. It will also allow us to add the number of parameters of your model to the `Extended Viewer`!

### 3) Make sure your model has an open license!
This is a leaderboard for Open LLMs, and we'd love for as many people as possible to know they can use your model ü§ó

### 4) Fill up your model card
When we add extra information about models to the leaderboard, it will be automatically taken from the model card

## In case of model failure
If your model is displayed in the `FAILED` category, its execution stopped.
Make sure you have followed the above steps first.
If everything is done, check you can launch the EleutherAIHarness on your model locally, using the above command without modifications (you can add `--limit` to limit the number of examples per task).
